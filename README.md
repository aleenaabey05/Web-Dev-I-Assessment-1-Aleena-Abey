# Web Dev I - Assessment 1: Set Exercises

This repository contains my solutions for **Assessment 1** of the Web Development I module. The exercises are designed to test fundamental web development skills, including semantic HTML, CSS styling, page layout, and web accessibility.

## Repository Structure

Each exercise is organized in its own folder for easy navigation:


## Instructions

- Open each folder to view the HTML/CSS files for that exercise.
- Each folder contains a `README` file with specific instructions for the exercise.
- Open the `index.html` file in a browser to see the live page.
- Comments are included in the code for clarity and explanation.

## Submission Notes

- All code is pushed to this GitHub repository before the assessment deadline.
- Proper naming, organization, and commenting have been applied throughout.
